## Prerequisite
This toolkit requires another repository of mine, [readHeader](https://github.com/CreLox/readHeader), to run.

## General workflow

## "Deconvolution"
As Knight and Selinger (1970) put it,
> ... Without careful consideration of the nature of the problem, deconvolutlon as an information-improving device can easily become an exercise in self-delusion.

## Normalization of event counts
Alba is a laser scanning microscopy setup. The amplification factor is determined by the setup and the objective but not by the scale of the FOV appointed for scanning. Therefore, the power of the excitation light on the sample plane and the corresponding area on the sample plane of the APD detector are not affected by the FOV appointed for scanning. Because the pixel dwell time is fixed, the event count per **pixel** is directly comparable, regardless of the scale of the FOV appointed for scanning.

## Acknowledgements
I would like to thank Dr. Damon Hoff (manager of the SMART Center at the Univerisity of Michigan) for his suggestions on the operations manual and his ground-laying contributions to scripts related to the I/O of data files.
