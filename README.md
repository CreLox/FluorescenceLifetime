## Prerequisite
This toolkit requires another repository of mine, [readHeader](https://github.com/CreLox/readHeader), to run.
## General workflow
## "Deconvolution"
As Knight and Selinger (1970) put it,
> ... Without careful consideration of the nature of the problem, deconvolutlon as an information-improving device can easily become an exercise in self-delusion.
## Acknowledgements
I would like to thank Dr. Damon Hoff (manager of the SMART Center at the Univerisity of Michigan) for his suggestions on the operations manual and his ground-laying contributions to scripts related to the I/O of data files.
